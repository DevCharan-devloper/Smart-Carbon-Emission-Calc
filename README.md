# Carbon Smart Calculator

Carbon Smart Calculator is a Flutter-based mobile application that helps users estimate their carbon emissions from everyday energy usage. The app provides a simple scoring system to evaluate environmental impact based on electricity consumption, air conditioning usage, and renewable energy adoption.

This project demonstrates mobile application development using Flutter with a focus on clean UI design, navigation, and user input handling.
